This is a temporary measure undertaken as part of [OHSS-2561](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OHSS-2561) whilst a longer-term solution is sought to make this configurable by cluster owners.

This change applies an extended login session duration of 7d to Hive Integration clusters.

This change should _not_ be applied to any cluster other than Hive Integration clusters.
