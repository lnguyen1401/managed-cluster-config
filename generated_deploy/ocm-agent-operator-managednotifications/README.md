# ocm-agent-operator ManagedNotifications-CR

This location manages the distribution of the OCM Agent Operator `ManagedNotification` CR to the OSD and ROSA fleet.

The purpose of the `ManagedNotification` CR is to define Service Log templates that map to AlertManager alerts, allowing the OCM Agent to build and send Service Logs when it is notified about those alerts.
